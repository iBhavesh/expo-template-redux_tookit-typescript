# React Native Expo template

A simple Expo template with the following features:

- Eslint & Prettier configured
- Simple project structure
- Small component library to get started with
- Redux Toolkit and typescript configured

It's easy to create a project, strip out the few components included, and still have the architecture in place to quickly start building an app.

## Usage

> Be sure to have the [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/expo-cli/) installed.

```bash
expo init --template expo-template-redux_toolkit-typescript
```
